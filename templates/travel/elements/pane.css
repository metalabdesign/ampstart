/**
 * pane
 *
 * Create a collapsable dropdown panel. The required markup is:
 *  div.pane(.pane-visible) > div.pane-overflow > div.pane-content
 *
 * NOTE: This element uses an unconventional approach to "hiding" content by
 * setting `opacity: 0` and `pointer-events: none`. This is to prevent nested
 * amp components from detecting their state as not visible when the panel is
 * hidden. It also enables adding css transitions as the closes.
 *
 * Modifier Classes:
 * - pane-visible: Show pane content. (content is otherwise hidden)
