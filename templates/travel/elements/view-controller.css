/**
 * view-controller
 *
 * Style an <amp-carousel> to behave as an app navigation view controller.
 *
 * The styled carousel stretches to fill the viewport and each slide's content
 * is wrapped in an element to provide overflow-y scrolling.
 *
 * This is definitely not the intended use for the carousel component. Building
 * this with custom css and amp-bind would be an option, unfortunately it would
 * introduce isues with amp component visibility detection failing when
 * changing views.
